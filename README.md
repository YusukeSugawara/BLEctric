# BLEctric

## Overview

This is a Android App project for own study purpose.

In the plan, this uses below elements:

* Common Android UI Framework
* [Android Bluetooth Low Energy Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html)
* [RxJava](http://reactivex.io/)
* [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/)

Especially, I want to explore how to test BLE Framework using Robolectric.
